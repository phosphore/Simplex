Simplex
=======

I've just transposed [IainNZ's linear programming solver JS](https://github.com/IainNZ/SimplexJS) in C# _(only the simplex part)_.

If you're working with LP, check out this page you may find useful - [octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/interpreter/Linear-Programming.html)'s (gnu.org) - to understand variables names.

Cheers :)
